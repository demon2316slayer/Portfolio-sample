Introduction
Thank you for purchasing this HTML/CSS/JS template! This template is designed to be responsive, visually appealing, and easy to customize. Below, you'll find a detailed guide to help you set up, use, and modify the template.

Files Included
- index.html - The main HTML structure of the website.
- style.css - All the styling for the website, including responsive design.
- app.js - JavaScript code for interactivity (e.g., animations, menu functionality).
- img/ - Placeholder images used in the template.
- template.zip - A placeholder ZIP file for the "Download Template" button (if applicable).

Features

2. Customizable Animations: Smooth fade-in animations for various elements.
3. Call-to-Action Button: Included in the Hero section for added interactivity.
4. Contact Form Layout: A visually designed form ready for customization.
5. Project Showcase: Grid-based layout to display projects.

Getting Started
1. Open the Template
   - Extract the ZIP file.
   - Open index.html in any web browser to view the template.

2. Editing the Content
   - Open index.html in a code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).
   - Replace placeholder text (e.g., "Lorem ipsum") with your own content.

3. Replacing Images
   - Go to the img/ folder.
   - Replace placeholder images (e.g., professional hero img.webp) with your own.
   - Ensure the new image names match the ones in index.html, or update the <img> tags accordingly.

Customizing the Design
1. Colors
   - Open style.css and locate color variables or specific selectors.
   - Replace the color codes (e.g., #2C3E50, #E74C3C) with your preferred colors.

2. Fonts
   - The template uses system fonts like 'Segoe UI' and 'Arial'.
   - To change fonts, add a new Google Font link in the <head> of index.html and update font-family in style.css.

3. Animations
   - Animations are defined in the @keyframes section of style.css.
   - To customize animations, adjust properties like opacity, transform, and transition.

4. Button Links
   - In the "Download Template" button, replace href="#" with your desired URL or leave it as-is for buyers to add functionality.

Adding Functionality
1. Dropdown Menu
   - The dropdown menu is already functional via JavaScript. No additional setup is needed.

2. Download Template Button
   - If you want to make the button functional:
      1. Host your ZIP file on a server or include it in the project folder.
      2. Update the href attribute in the <a> tag for the button.

Best Practices
- Use compressed images for faster loading.
- Test the template on multiple browsers and devices.
- Keep your HTML, CSS, and JS files clean and organized for easy updates.
